👨🏻‍💻 I'm a postdoctoral researcher in Bioinformatics at Tor Vergata University of Rome.

⚗️ I'm mainly interested in tumor metabolism, immunotherapy, long non-coding RNA genes, and genomics in general.

⌨️ But I'm also a very interested in data science, machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).

✨ and in learning more about large language models!

🧬 I'm currently working on cancer metabolism, the research of a modular organization of lncRNA genes and on NLP-based representation methods for biological sequences for machine learning analysis.
